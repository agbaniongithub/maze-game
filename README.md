# Installation
    Open the repository on your command line and run:
    ./raycast

# Usage
    -Task 0: Walls
    I created a window with SDL2.
    I used raycasting to draw walls on my window.
    The color of the walls are different from the color of the ground/ceiling.

    -Task 1: Orientation.
    Walls facing NORTH and SOUTH are in a different color as walls facing EAST and WEST, making it look 3 dimentional.

    -Task 2: Rotations
    I implemented logic to make the camera move left and right, based on the mouse movement.

    -Task 3: Move
    I provided a way to move the player/camera up, down, left and right with the arrow keys on the keyboard.

    -Task 4: Ouch!
    I made sure the player is unable to enter walls.

    -Task 5: Parser
    I made sure my map array is coming from a different file.

    -Task 6: Draw the map

    -Task 7: Coding Style + Documentation
    I made sure all the codes in my repository meet the Holberton School coding stye using the betty checker.

    -Task 8: Textures
