# Installation
    Open the repository on your command line and run:
    ./raycast

# Usage
    -Task 0: Walls
    I created a window with SDL2.
    I used raycasting to draw walls on my window.
    The color of the walls are different from the color of the ground/ceiling.

    -Task 1: Orientation.
    Walls facing NORTH and SOUTH are in a different color as walls facing EAST and WEST, making it look 3 dimentional.

    -Task 2: Rotations
    I implemented logic to make the camera move left and right, based on the mouse movement.

    -Task 3: Move
    I provided a way to move the player/camera up, down, left and right with the arrow keys on the keyboard.

    -Task 4: Ouch!
    I made sure the player is unable to enter walls.

    -Task 5: Parser
    I made sure my map array is coming from a different file.

    -Task 6: Draw the map

    -Task 7: Coding Style + Documentation
    I made sure all the codes in my repository meet the Holberton School coding stye using the betty checker.

    -Task 8: Textures

# Story
    Exploring the ALX Project Maze Game: A Journey into Ray Casting and SDL2

    Introduction: Welcome to my journey through the ALX Project Maze Game, a first-person shooter (FPS) built using ray casting and SDL2. I dove deep into the technologies utilized in creating video games.

    Story Behind the Project: I love video games and most especially FPS shooters. The very first day I saw the Maze Project I got fascinated about learning what it take to write video game code.

    Accomplishments: I achieved a robust architecture utilizing SDL2 for graphics rendering and user input, coupled with ray casting for real-time 3D rendering. My Maze Game aims to support dynamic maze generation, immersive sound effects, and a fluid movement system that enhances player engagement.

    Technical Challenge: One of our most demanding challenges was optimizing ray casting algorithms for real-time rendering.

    Learnings: This project provided invaluable insights into game engine architecture and performance optimization. It underscored the importance of iterative development and the impact of efficient algorithms on user experience. Personally, I gained a deeper appreciation for the complexities of game design and the iterative nature of problem-solving in software development.

    About Me: I am passionate about bridging creativity with information and technology, driven by a desire to create meaningful experiences through software. You can explore my project further on GitHub, experience the game on its deployed page, and learn more about my journey my portfolio page. Connect with me on LinkedIn to discuss game development, UX/UX design, web development or simply to share your thoughts on my project.
